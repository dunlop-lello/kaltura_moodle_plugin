# Kaltura Plugin for Moodle

Kaltura's Video Package for Moodle makes it easy to add the robust capabilities of Kaltura's open source online video platform to any Moodle site. The package was developed specifically for Moodle and integrates with other features and modules, such as resources and activities, so that users can upload and embed media easily.

## How to contribute a pull-request
For each version, we keep 2 branches: MOODLE_XX_DEV and MOODLE_XX_STABLE.


MOODLE_XX_DEV is our development branch - all approved pull requests are merged to this branch. Once in a while we drop a version to our QA team.
After our QA team verifies the changes made in the corresponding DEV branch - they are merged to the STABLE branch.

So, when issuing a PR - please make sure that:
* You are checkout out of a DEV branch.
* In your pull-request, the base branch is indeed the DEV branch you checked-out from.

Thank you for taking the time to read this!
